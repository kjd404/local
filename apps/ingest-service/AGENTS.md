# Ingest Service Guidelines

Refer to the shared [apps/AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for overarching application conventions.

In this service:

- Use constructor-based dependency injection.
- Keep classes small and cohesive.
- Prefer integration tests with a temporary database.

## Migrations & DB
- Core schema migrations live under `ops/sql/` and can be applied via `bazel run //ops/sql:db_migrate`.
- jOOQ model is generated by `//ops/sql:jooq_model` and is a dependency of this app; rebuild after schema changes.

## Bazel Targets

- Build binary: `bazel build //apps/ingest-service:ingest_app`
- Run binary: `bazel run //apps/ingest-service:ingest_app -- --mode=scan`
- New-account CLI: `bazel run //apps/ingest-service:new_account_cli`
 - Validate DB (counts/dupes): `bazel run //apps/ingest-service:db_validate`

Notes
- Dependencies are resolved via bzlmod (`MODULE.bazel` + `rules_jvm_external`).
- Resources under `src/main/resources/mappings` are packaged and available on the classpath (e.g., `/mappings/example.yaml`).
- Tests run under Bazel via JUnit 5 ConsoleLauncher: `bazel test //apps/ingest-service:ingest_tests`.
 - For Python utilities, use the repo venv: `bazel run //:venv` then point your IDE to `.venv/bin/python`.
